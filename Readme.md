# ðŸ“¦ InventoryAPI Server

## Overview

**InventoryAPI Server** is a backend API built to manage inventory operations efficiently, using modern web technologies. Developed with #TypeScript and based on the **PERN stack** (PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.js), the project offers a robust API with extensive documentation via **Swagger**, and includes unit and integration tests implemented with **Jest** and **Supertest**.

This project highlights backend skills in handling databases, testing, API development, and TypeScript-driven development.

## Key Features

- ðŸ›  **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience.
- ðŸ“š **Comprehensive API Documentation**: Detailed with **Swagger**, enabling users to interact with all API endpoints.
- ðŸ“¦ **Sequelize ORM**: For seamless interaction with a **PostgreSQL** database.
- âœ… **Testing**: Unit and integration tests implemented using **Jest** and **Supertest** to ensure API reliability.
- âš¡ **Nodemon**: Automatic server restarts during development.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express**: Web framework for handling API routes.
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing system for JavaScript.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database.
- **Sequelize**: ORM for PostgreSQL to handle models and queries.
- **Swagger**: API documentation.
- **Jest**: Testing framework for unit and integration tests.
- **Supertest**: HTTP assertions for API testing.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

Running Tests
This project includes unit and integration tests using Jest and Supertest to ensure API reliability.

To run all tests:

```bash

npm run test
```
To run tests with coverage:
```bash

npm run test:coverage
```
Test coverage includes:

API route handlers

Business logic
API Documentation
The API is fully documented using Swagger. Once the server is running, you can access the documentation at:

```bash

http://localhost:4000/docs/
```
The Swagger interface provides a detailed overview of all available endpoints, including request formats, parameters, and response structures.
